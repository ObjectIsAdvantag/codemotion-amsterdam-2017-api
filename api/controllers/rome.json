But what is Docker and why has it become such a hot topic? Why is Microsoft updating Windows 2016 so be a Docker container host? What does using Docker mean for your application architecture or can you just take any application and host it using Docker? In this session Maurice de Beijer will explain the history of Docker as well as explain how you could use it with your applications. He will also explain what else, besides Docker, you will need to add to your architecture.",

            "description": "Most React-Redux applications store the work in progress as is in a database. It is fine to treat objects like this in a small application. But this is not optimal when applications are complex. Prefer the CQRS design pattern for more complex applications. Combining this with Event-Sourcing is an even more powerful solution. Event-Sourcing ensures that every action is stored as a separate domain event. These domain events are the CQRS write model. These events also project into a secondary database. This projection builds the CQRS read model for the application.",

            "description": "Rapid advent of Android platforms has dawned an era of sophisticated malware that attacks\r\nthese systems. To better understand this slew of threats, in this talk, I will first\r\nintroduce CopperDroid, an automatic VMI-based dynamic analysis system to reconstruct the\r\nbehaviors of Android malware. I will then discuss the efficacy of such behavioral profiles\r\nto differentiate between families of malware. Finally, in a departure from traditional\r\nclassification techniques, I further show how a statistical machine learning evaluation\r\nfacilitates near-perfect accuracy by considering prediction sets",
